                <p>During my leisure time. I  often love to play my acoustic guitar and sing my favorite songs. Making music is very therapeutic for me and heal my soul. <br> I also enjoy recording my original songs & cover songs.  After I finished recording my music tracks. <br>I usually like to do mixing/mastering all my audio tracks and upload on my Social Media platforms like Facebook, Youtube, and Soundcloud. <br>I sometimes get involved at my local church during worship service.</p>
