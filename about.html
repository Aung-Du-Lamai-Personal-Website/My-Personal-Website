            <p>During my leisure time. I often love to play my acoustic guitar and sing my favorite songs.
                Making
                music is very therapeutic for me and heal my soul. <br> I also enjoy recording my original songs
                &
                cover songs. After I finished recording my music tracks. <br>I usually like to do
                mixing/mastering
                all my audio tracks and upload on my Social Media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and
                Soundcloud.
                <br>I sometimes get involved at my local church during worship service.
